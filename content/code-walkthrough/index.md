# Code Walkthrough

This section provides detailed walkthroughs of the NeuralLog codebase, helping you understand how the different components work together.

## Overview

The code walkthroughs are designed to help developers understand the NeuralLog codebase and how the different components interact. Each walkthrough focuses on a specific aspect of the system, providing step-by-step explanations of the code.

## Available Walkthroughs

1. [Master Secret Generation](./01-master-secret-generation.md) - How the master secret is generated and used to derive the master KEK
2. [KEK Version Creation](./02-kek-version-creation.md) - How KEK versions are created and stored
3. [Admin Setup](./03-admin-setup.md) - How the first admin is set up with access to the KEK
4. [Log Creation](./04-log-creation.md) - How logs are encrypted and stored
5. [User Provisioning](./05-user-provisioning.md) - How additional users are provisioned with access to KEKs
6. [Log Reading](./06-log-reading.md) - How logs are retrieved and decrypted
7. [Key Rotation](./07-key-rotation.md) - How KEKs are rotated for enhanced security

## Coming Soon

More code walkthroughs will be added in the future, covering additional aspects of the NeuralLog system.
