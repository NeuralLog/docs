# NeuralLog: Comprehensive Zero-Knowledge Architecture

## Overview

NeuralLog implements a true zero-knowledge architecture for telemetry and logging, ensuring that sensitive data remains private while still enabling powerful search, analysis, and AI integration capabilities. This document provides a comprehensive overview of NeuralLog's zero-knowledge architecture, explaining the core principles, implementation details, and security properties.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Server Knowledge**: The server never possesses encryption keys or plaintext data
2. **Deterministic Key Hierarchy**: All keys are derived from master secrets using deterministic paths
3. **Client-Side Cryptography**: All encryption and decryption happens on the client
4. **Searchable Encryption**: Enables searching encrypted logs without decryption
5. **Tenant Isolation**: Complete cryptographic separation between tenants
6. **Metadata-Level RBAC**: Access control implemented purely through metadata
7. **M-of-N Key Sharing**: Secure key recovery and administrative transitions

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Auth Service**: Manages authentication, authorization, and API key verification
   - Uses Redis for fast access to verification hashes and RBAC metadata
   - Never stores actual keys, only verification hashes
   - Implements zero-knowledge proofs for API key verification
   - Manages tenant isolation and multi-tenant design

2. **Web Application**: Stateless Next.js application
   - All cryptographic operations happen in the browser
   - No server-side sessions or state
   - Implements client-side key derivation and encryption
   - Provides user interface for key management and sharing

3. **Logs Service**: Stores and indexes encrypted logs
   - Handles search queries using searchable encryption tokens
   - Performs analysis on encrypted data without decryption
   - Implements zero-knowledge reports and signal generation
   - Provides AI integration through the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

4. **Redis**: Tenant-specific Redis instance shared between auth and logs services
   - Stores verification hashes, RBAC metadata, and search indices
   - Maintains strict tenant isolation
   - Implements efficient token-based search
   - Stores encrypted data with no access to plaintext

5. **Client SDKs**: Libraries for various programming languages
   - Handle client-side encryption and token generation
   - Derive encryption keys from API keys
   - Implement searchable encryption token generation
   - Provide seamless integration with existing logging frameworks

### Deployment Models

NeuralLog supports two deployment models with identical security guarantees:

1. **NeuralLog Cloud**: Fully managed service
   - Zero operational overhead
   - Automatic updates and scaling
   - Global availability
   - Predictable subscription pricing

2. **Self-Hosted NeuralLog**: Complete control
   - Your infrastructure, your data
   - Docker and Kubernetes ready
   - Air-gap support
   - Full feature parity with cloud version

Both deployment models provide the same zero-knowledge security guarantees because all encryption happens client-side.

## Key Management System

### Deterministic Hierarchical Key Derivation (DHKD)

All keys in the system are derived from master secrets using deterministic paths:

```
master_secret
├── tenant/{tenantId}/encryption
│   └── Used for encrypting tenant-wide data
├── tenant/{tenantId}/search
│   └── Used for generating search tokens
├── tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/api-key
│   └── Used for generating API keys
├── tenant/{tenantId}/user/{userId}/auth
│   └── Used for user authentication
├── tenant/{tenantId}/log/{logId}/encryption
│   └── Used for encrypting log entries
└── tenant/{tenantId}/log/{logId}/search
    └── Used for generating log-specific search tokens
```

### Key Derivation Function

Keys are derived using HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function):

1. **Extract Phase**: Extracts entropy from the master secret and salt
2. **Expand Phase**: Expands the extracted key material to the desired length
3. **Path-Based Derivation**: Uses the hierarchical path as context for derivation
4. **Deterministic Output**: Same inputs always produce the same key

### Master Secret Management

The master secret can be managed in several ways:

1. **Password-Based**: For individual users or small teams
   - Master secret derived from a strong password
   - Can be regenerated anytime with the same password
   - Suitable for development environments

2. **M-of-N Secret Sharing**: For organizations with multiple administrators
   - Master secret split using Shamir's Secret Sharing
   - Requires M of N shares to reconstruct
   - Provides redundancy and security
   - Suitable for production environments

3. **Hardware Security Module (HSM)**: For enterprise deployments
   - Master secret stored in hardware security modules
   - Physical security for the most sensitive key
   - Suitable for high-security environments

### Key Rotation

Keys can be rotated while maintaining backward compatibility:

1. **API Key Rotation**:
   - Generate a new API key using a new key ID
   - Store new verification hash
   - Both old and new keys work during transition period
   - Revoke old key after transition

2. **Master Secret Rotation**:
   - Reconstruct current master secret
   - Generate new master secret
   - Re-encrypt critical metadata with new keys
   - Update verification hashes
   - Revoke old master secret

## Zero-Knowledge Authentication

### API Key Verification

NeuralLog's authentication system never stores actual API keys:

1. When a developer generates an API key, only a verification hash is sent to the server
2. The actual API key is shown once and saved by the developer
3. When the API key is used, we verify it against the hash without ever storing the key itself
4. For enhanced security, zero-knowledge proofs can be used for API key verification

### M-of-N Key Sharing

For enterprise security, NeuralLog supports Shamir's Secret Sharing:

1. The master secret is split into N shares
2. Any M shares can reconstruct the secret (where M ≤ N)
3. This ensures no single administrator has complete control
4. Perfect for secure key recovery and administrative transitions
5. Enables secure approval workflows for sensitive operations

## Encrypted Data Storage

### Log Encryption

All data in NeuralLog is stored with end-to-end encryption:

1. **Content Encryption**: Log content is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
   - Provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity
   - Uses random IVs to ensure that identical plaintext encrypts to different ciphertext
   - Authentication tags verify that the ciphertext has not been tampered with

2. **Key Derivation**: Encryption keys are derived from API keys
   - Never sent to the server
   - Unique keys for each log entry
   - Deterministic derivation for authorized access

3. **Storage**: The server stores only encrypted data
   - No access to plaintext
   - No ability to decrypt
   - Complete separation of data and keys

### Searchable Encryption

NeuralLog implements a novel approach to searchable encryption:

1. **Token Generation**: Search tokens are generated client-side using HMAC with tenant-specific keys
   - Deterministic but secure tokens from words
   - Uses a different key from the content encryption key
   - Preserves equality relationships while hiding actual values

2. **Token Indexing**: Tokens are indexed on the server without revealing the underlying terms
   - Server can efficiently index and query tokens
   - No knowledge of what the tokens represent
   - Efficient storage and retrieval

3. **Search Process**: Searches match tokens without decrypting log content
   - Client generates search tokens from query terms
   - Server matches tokens against the index
   - Returns encrypted entries that match
   - No decryption on the server side

4. **Result Decryption**: Only the client can decrypt the returned log entries
   - Uses client-side keys to decrypt
   - Server never sees plaintext results
   - Complete end-to-end privacy

### Security Properties

NeuralLog's searchable encryption provides:

1. **Zero Knowledge**: Server never learns plaintext content or search terms
2. **Tenant Isolation**: Search tokens are tenant-specific
3. **Forward Security**: Revoked users cannot search historical data
4. **Minimal Leakage**: Only reveals which documents contain the same terms

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access control is implemented purely at the metadata level:

1. **Role Definitions**: Stored as metadata in Redis
   - Defines what actions users can perform
   - Specifies which logs users can access
   - Configurable at a granular level

2. **Permission Checks**: Performed against metadata without revealing keys
   - Server checks permissions before returning encrypted data
   - No access to the actual decryption keys
   - Enforced at the API level

3. **Revocation**: Implemented as entries in revocation lists
   - Immediate effect
   - No need to re-encrypt data
   - Efficient and secure

4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all RBAC changes
   - Who made what changes when
   - Immutable record for compliance
   - Searchable for security reviews

## Zero-Knowledge Analysis
